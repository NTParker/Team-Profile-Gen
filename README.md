This application allow the user to create an HTML webpage displaying team member information through the command line. When a user runs the application, they are given prompts in the command line to provide information on the member's of their team. The user first provides information about the team manager and then is able to add as many engineer or intern roles as needed. When the user indicates there are no more team members to be added, HTML and CSS are dynamically generated that provide a nicely formatted team roster.
